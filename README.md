# Product Engagement & Stickiness Analytics (Google Sheets)

Tools: Google Sheets, time-based analysis, KPI dashboards

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing user engagement in an e-commerce product after the release of new features.
The main goal was to evaluate how these changes affected user activity, usage frequency, and overall engagement, as well as to identify behavioral patterns related to user retention.
The project demonstrates a product analytics approach, including working with key engagement metrics, interpreting results, and translating insights into business recommendations.

## Business Context
After launching new features, the product team needed to understand:
- whether users return to the product regularly
- if a usage habit is being formed
- whether user activity is stable or affected by seasonality or external factors
The analysis supports product and business decisions related to further product improvements and user retention strategy.

## Data Description
The dataset contains aggregated user activity data, including:
- daily, weekly, and monthly active users
- a time period sufficient to analyze engagement dynamics
All calculations and analysis were performed in Google Sheets using formulas and aggregations.

## Key Metrics
The following metrics were calculated and analyzed:
- DAU (Daily Active Users) — measures daily user activity and short-term engagement
- WAU (Weekly Active Users) — reflects weekly engagement trends
- MAU (Monthly Active Users) — represents the size of the active user base
- Product Stickiness (DAU / MAU) — evaluates how frequently users return to the product and whether regular usage behavior is formed

## Analysis & Insights
- Comparing DAU, WAU, and MAU helped assess the stability of user activity over time and identify periods of decreased engagement.
- The product stickiness metric indicates that product usage is relatively episodic, suggesting that users do not consistently return on a daily basis.
- Engagement dynamics may be influenced by external factors, including competitive pressure and changing user behavior.

## Business Implications
Low product stickiness poses risks for sustainable product growth:
- users may not develop a habit of regular product usage
- MAU growth may be driven mainly by new users rather than retained ones
- the long-term impact of product and marketing initiatives may be limited
